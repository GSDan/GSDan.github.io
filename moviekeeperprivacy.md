# Your Privacy with MovieKeeper

Your privacy is important to us and we believe you should always know what data we collect from you and the ways in which we use it. Our aim is to give you meaningful control and empower you to make the best decisions about the information you share with us.

- MovieKeeper uses Google's Firebase to authenticate user accounts. As such, your email address will be stored in Google's servers.
- Your information is not and will not be shared with any other external organisation.
- MovieKeeper uses the eBay API to try and match barcodes with movies. The barcodes you scan are sent to eBay, but none of your identifiable information is sent to them. eBay only see our information.
- We will not use your email address for marketing purposes. Any emails we do send will related to issues surrounding your account (e.g. forgotten passwords).
