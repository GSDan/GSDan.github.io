## About the App

Developed by Newcastle University's Openlab in collaboration with Consultant
Dermatologist Dr Philip Hampton, MySkinSelfie makes it easier to keep track of
how your skin conditions change over time.

By helping you take consistent photographs of your skin through an overlay
system, MySkinSelfie can be used to ease the task of keeping track of the
progress of your skin conditions. Keep your photos organised by date, condition
type and location on your body, tracking how they change over time through notes
and the handy comparison tool. Taken images are stored in the cloud over a
secure connection, meaning you can access them across multiple devices for years
to come - perfect for long-term condition tracking.

All uploaded files are encrypted, meaning that you can be safe in the knowledge
that no-one will get their hands on your sensitive images. Photos are kept out
of your device's default image gallery and you even have the option to lock the
application behind a PIN, preventing any potential embarrassment.

The mobile applications were developed in Xamarin Forms, with the REST server
running Web API 2.0. Because the whole project is written in C#, each component
can share common code and be opened from the same Visual Studio solution.
MySkinSelfie is open-source, and [can be downloaded from my GitHub](https://github.com/GSDan/MySkinSelfie).

## MySkinSelfie as a HCI Research Project

The research goal of MySkinSelfie was to investigate if technology-assisted
patient-self monitoring---in combination with traditional healthcare
systems---could be used to ease the burden of unnecessary patient referrals upon
both the patients themselves and the UK's underfunded National Health Service.
The application was deployed within several NHS practices within the North of
England, with it being recommended to patients living with applicable skin
conditions. As well as an ongoing study within the NHS, several evaluations have
been undertaken and published.
