## About TalkFutures ans Strategy 2030

TalkFutures was developed as a component of Strategy 2030, a research project
within the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC)
which aimed to understand the issues and challenges which the Federation will
face in the near future. Through workshop engagements with teams and individuals
throughout the IFRC (from volunteers in Mexico to leaders in Geneva), several
key themes and issues were identified which members believed the Federation
should prepare for. These included topics such as the impacts of rising sea
levels due to climate change, and mass migration with the increasing trend of
urbanization. 

Once these issues had been identified, the next step of Strategy 2030 was to
collect ideas of how the IFRC needed to change in order to best prepare for
them. The TalkFutures app was created and deployed to collect these ideas from
IFRC members across the globe.

We produced the TalkFutures application in Xamarin Android and Xamarin iOS, as
part of a small team based in the Federation's office in Geneva. Based on the
existing open-source project Gabber (developed by Jay Rainey at Open Lab),
TalkFutures makes it easy for participants to contribute semi-structured,
qualitative audio data (e.g. in the form of interviews). The application also
makes it easy for participants to control others' access to their contributed
audio recordings, with participants within a conversation being able to withdraw
their consent, even after it has been uploaded.

Once uploaded, audio recordings are made available on the TalkFutures website,
where they can be filtered by discussion topic or even which National Society
the participants work in. By the conclusion of the Strategy 2030 investigation,
members from 86 different National Societies contributed recordings using the application.

## Resulting Publications

We are hoping to publish our work on TalkFutures at upcoming academic venues.
