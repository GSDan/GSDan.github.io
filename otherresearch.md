Since joining Open Lab in late 2014 as a Research Associate and joining the
Digital Civics CDT in 2015, I have been involved in a multitude of other
researchers' projects. This page will give a brief overview of the other
projects that I've contributed to.

## Speeching
Speeching was a mobile application, designed to assist in speech and language
therapy (SLT). The application gave participants several different SLT exercises
and recorded their speech. The speech recordings were then given to online crowd
workers, who attempted to correctly identify the words in the recordings and
gave feedback to how clear they found different aspects of the recording. The
participants could then use this feedback to gain a better understanding of
which elements of their speech others struggled to understand, and update their
therapy sessions accordingly. The findings of the study were [published at CHI
2016](https://doi.org/10.1145/2858036.2858321).

## VoiceBoard
I produced the client and server-side logic for VoiceBoard, a Raspberry
Pi-powered peer support platform for people experiencing homelessness.
Participants living in shelters were given a technology probe, which allowed
participants to send voice communications to each other anonymously. The
physical device was designed to fit unobtrusively into a the shelters' bedrooms,
appearing to be little more than a cork noticeboard with some buttons, which
could be used to select options in a narrated menu.

## Mooqita
I worked in the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley as a
visiting student researcher during September--November 2017. In this time I
assisted with the [Mooqita project](https://www.mooqita.org/), which aims to
give users of massive online learning courses (MOOCs) opportunities to solve
real-world challenges created by potential employers. During this period I
worked within a small team to ideate, design and develop a prototype student
onboarding experience for Mooqita. We also planned and tested a series of
participant research workshops designed to evaluate the prototype and explore
how it could be improved.

## Coaching

As a Research Associate at Culture Lab, I produced a technology probe called
'Coaching': a video capture application designed for use by caregivers, parents
or other gatekeepers. The application users record video and tag sections of
their captured footage with metadata, before uploading it for feedback or
discussion. Practitioners could create "schemes" on the Coaching website and
enrol users into them. Each scheme can have "tags" created for it, which
enrolled users could then use to highlight sections of their footage. Footage
collected and tagged in the application can be uploaded for review by the
practitioner on the website. A simple chat client between the app and website
has been implemented, allowing practitioners to send feedback.

## Let's Talk Parks
I helped design and run a series of workshop activities in the ['Let's Talk
Parks'](https://letstalkparks.co.uk/) project, which involved a series of
engagements with members of the public, park rangers and city council officials.
These workshops explored how Newcastle's parks should be run in the future,
having to cope increasingly limited public funding. These engagements eventually
led into ParkLearn (later renamed to OurPlace), [my main PhD research project](/ourplace).
